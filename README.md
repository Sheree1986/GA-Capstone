# Capstone-Project

## Open Access 

Open Access is an information management systems that will allow a user to search 🔍 for information on Neurodiversity and how it is presented differerently in males and female. This will be a q


### Technical requirements ⚙️
- [] You must create 2 apps: Everyone must build and deploy an Angular frontend that communicates with a Springboot backend API.
- [] Be a complete product.
- [] Implement thoughtful user stories
- [] Be deployed online We recommend Heroku or AWS.

### Necessary Deliverables 🏁
- [x] Your project idea (a brief 2-3 sentence description of your app)
- [x] A list of your models and their properties (Having a ERD would be even better)
- [ ] These and any other planning assets (wireframes, user stories, ERD, etc) should go inside a planning/ directory inside of your front-end project repository.        Planning and Process is one category by which we will be evaluating your project.
- [x] A README.md file with:
* Explanations of the machineries used.
* A couple of paragraphs about the general approach you took.
* Descriptions of any unsolved problems or major hurdles you had to overcome.
* A link to your planning documentation for how you broke down this project with deliverables and timelines.
* Installation instructions for any dependencies.
* A link to your user stories, ERD diagrams — who are your users, what do they want, and why?

#### Approach 🚂
The way we first came about approaching our project started off rocky- We tried to divide and conquer tasks but very soon learned that was not the best way to work for us. After our struggles with that we started to join our efforts to work on the same problems this was more efficient for us because altough it seemed like it would take more time this method allowed us both to understand the concepts better by disscusing them as we went by. We tried to divide the workload of the project amoung us into certain days as seen below for example on monday we were dedicated to setting up the Spring enviroment which we finished before the end of the day. Then after we started tuesdays workload which is where we started to fall behind on because as demonstrated below there where more objectives to be met and as said before our way of working up until the end of tuesday was still divide and conquer. Once we started working in sync we approached each day with objectives that were put in place and personally curated for our team by our squad leader to help us stay on track.

#### Machineries Used 🧰
* Service Class talks to The Controller which talks to the Repository
* LucidCharts website to create our entity relationship models
* Postman --> We used postman(API platform) to help us test and build our endpoints
* PgAdmin --> we used pgadmins sources to help us interact with our databases in viewing our tables that we built
* IntelliJ --> worked inside of intelliJ wrtitng code to create our monolithic back-end. Within intelliJ we were able to sync up to springboot in order to use tomcat to run our application.
* Maven --> Helping to building dependencies
* Spring Boot --> Helped us in the running of our actual project without needing an external webserver - Instead we can use an embedded web server to run it, which in our case we used Tomcat 🐱
