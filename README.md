# Capstone-Project

## Open Access 

The Open Access is an information management systems that will allow a user to view information on Neurodiversity and how it is presented differently in men and women. This often lead to misdiagnosis or a diagnosis is late adulthood. Using a trivia style game The app will allow user to test their knowledge and challenge misinformation/bias on what neurodiverse signifies. 

Heroku Frontend Deployment = [Front](https://open-access.herokuapp.com/)
Heroku backend Deployment = [Back](https://open-access-backend.herokuapp.com/)


### Technical requirements ‚öôÔ∏è
- [X] You must create 2 apps: Everyone must build and deploy an Angular frontend that communicates with a Spring boot backend API.
- [X] Be a complete product.
- [X] Implement thoughtful user stories
- [X] Be deployed online We recommend Heroku or AWS.

### Necessary Deliverables üèÅ
- [x] Your project idea (a brief 2-3 sentence description of your app)
- [x] A list of your models and their properties (Having a ERD would be even better)
- [x] A README.md



* Explanations of the machineries used.


* A couple of paragraphs about the general approach you took.
* Descriptions of any unsolved problems or major hurdles you had to overcome.
* A link to your planning documentation for how you broke down this project with deliverables and timelines.
* Installation instructions for any dependencies.
* A link to your user stories, ERD diagrams ‚Äî who are your users, what do they want, and why?

### User Stories ÔøΩ
* As a user I should be able to find information on the different conditions that falls under the neurodiverse umbrella.
* As a user I should be able to start a trivia game that genrates random questions and keep a score of the session in progress.
* As a user I should be able to reset a game occur.


### Bonus

* As a user I should be able to register
* As a user I should be able to sign on to an authorized portal. 
* On the above portal be able to view my user details
* Ability to delete my account on the portal
* The ability to access the app via a live deployment.
* As an admin I can complete full CRUD on trivia questions and answers.
* Possible cms build  for the information part** stretch goals.



#### Struggles
Spent three days tying to fix what would later be determined to be a Cors error on the back end.


#### Approach
Overall apporach was to get the backend up and running than deployed. Once that was completed I worked on deploying than completing the frontend. 

#### Machineries Used
 Angular, JavaScript, Typescript, HTML, CSS, Java, Spring Boot, Maven, PostgreSQL, PgAdmin, Postman
