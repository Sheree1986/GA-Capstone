Heroku backend Deployment = https://open-access-backend.herokuapp.com/


### Technical requirements ⚙️
- [] You must create 2 apps: Everyone must build and deploy an Angular frontend that communicates with a Spring boot backend API.

- [] Be deployed online We recommend Heroku or AWS.

### Necessary Deliverables 🏁
- [x] Your project idea (a brief 2-3 sentence description of your app)
- [x] A list of your models and their properties (Having a ERD would be even better)
- [ ] These and any other planning assets (wire frames, user stories, ERD, etc) should go inside a planning/ directory inside of your front-end project repository.        Planning and Process is one category by which we will be evaluating your project.

* As a user I should be able to find information on the different conditions that falls under the neurodiverse umbrella.
* Using a serach feature I should be able to look up a work to see information that contain that work generated.
* As a user I should be able to start a trivia game that genrates random questions and keep a score of the session in progress.
* As a user I should be able to reset a game occur.


### Bonus

* As a user I should be able to register
* As a user I should be able to sign on to an authorized portal. 
* On the above portal be able to view my user details
* Ability to delete my account on the portal
* The ability to access the app via a live deployment.
* As an admin I can complete full CRUD on trivia questions and answers.
